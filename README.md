The main program is flow_log_parser.py. To run the the program you just need to type 'python flow_log_parser.py' in the terminal, the output will be output.txt. It uses lookup.csv flow_log.txt to generate outputs. Those files are created based on the example provided in e-mail. generate_large_flow.py and generate_lookup_file.py are used to generate flow_log_10MB.txt and lookup_file_10000.csv to test the requirement. To see the output for large size flow log and lookup file, uncomment large example part in flow_log_parser.py and comment simple size flow part. Then rerun 'python flow_log_parser.py' in the terminal to see the outcome. The program assumes the 6th field of each flow log record is dstport, 7th field is protocol. For protocol field, 6 means tcp, 17 means udp, others is assumed ICMP. The program is partially written by AI, but is examined by me and make sure the final code accomplishes the task.
